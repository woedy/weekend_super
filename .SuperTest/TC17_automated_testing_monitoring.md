# Test Case TC17: Automated Testing and Monitoring Coverage

- **User Story Reference:** QA-1 Automated testing & monitoring
- **Acceptance Criteria Covered:** AC-22.1, AC-22.2, AC-22.3, AC-22.4

## Objective
Ensure automated test suites and monitoring integrations cover critical backend and mobile flows with CI enforcement and alerting.

## Preconditions
- CI pipeline accessible (GitHub Actions) with ability to trigger runs.
- Backend, Flutter client, and admin repos configured with unit/integration tests.
- Sentry (or equivalent) project set up for error monitoring.

## Steps
1. Trigger CI workflow manually and confirm backend unit/integration tests execute (auth, orders, payouts).
2. Run Flutter widget/integration tests locally for client and cook apps; review coverage reports.
3. Execute end-to-end smoke tests (e.g., Cypress) simulating full order lifecycle.
4. Introduce a controlled exception in staging to verify monitoring alerts are captured in Sentry with appropriate tagging.
5. Review CI gate settings to ensure PR merges are blocked on failing tests or missing coverage thresholds.

## Expected Results
- All automated tests pass and report coverage metrics meeting defined thresholds.
- End-to-end tests validate cross-service flows and produce artifacts (screenshots/videos).
- Monitoring alert surfaces within agreed SLA and routes to on-call channel.
- CI status checks required for merge and surfaced in repository branch protection rules.

## Postconditions
- Test suites documented with latest pass results and artifacts stored for audit.
- Monitoring dashboards reflect test incident and resolution notes.

## Notes
- Evaluate flaky test retries and quarantine policy compliance.
